She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
Let's think step by step. Put your final answer within ####.
####","Multiplying the number of eggs she eats with three (3) by the number of muffins she bakes with four (4) gives us:
```
6 x 4 = 24
```
Dividing the total amount (24) by the number of eggs she eats (16) gives us:
```
1/16 = 0.000833333 or 8.33% of her daily eggs consumption
```
According to her daily egg consumption, Janet averages 16 eggs per day, and 8.33% is her share of the remaining 7.34%. So, her income at the farmers' market is:
```
7.34 - $2 * 8.33%
= $4.92
```
